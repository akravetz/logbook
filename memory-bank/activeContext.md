# Active Context

## Current Focus
Shifted to backend-first development approach. Established comprehensive backend design principles and preparing to implement the workout API.

## Recent Work Completed

### Backend Design Principles (DONE)
- Established modern Python backend architecture
- Chose async-first approach with FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0
- Defined functional cohesion project structure
- Created comprehensive testing strategy with transaction isolation
- Set up development automation with Taskfiles
- Implemented security-first approach with pre-commit hooks

### Technology Stack Finalized (DONE)
- **Package Management**: uv (not poetry/pip)
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI with full async
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy 2.0
- **Migrations**: Atlas (not Alembic)
- **Testing**: pytest + testcontainers
- **Code Quality**: ruff + pre-commit + gitleaks
- **Development**: Taskfile for automation

### API Design (DONE)
- RESTful endpoints for all resources
- Nested resource pattern for exercise executions
- Consistent error handling
- Pagination strategy
- Authentication flow (Google SSO)

## Next Steps

### 1. Backend Implementation (NEXT)
- Initialize project with uv
- Set up project structure following functional cohesion
- Configure Atlas for migrations
- Implement core models (User, Exercise, Workout)
- Create API endpoints with proper async patterns

### 2. Testing Infrastructure
- Set up testcontainers for PostgreSQL
- Implement transaction isolation pattern
- Create comprehensive test fixtures
- Write integration tests for complete flows

### 3. Development Environment
- Create Taskfile.yml with all commands
- Set up pre-commit hooks
- Configure development docker-compose
- Create .env.example with all variables

## Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Backend-first approach**: Build and test API before frontend
2. **Functional cohesion**: Organize by business domain, not layers
3. **Async everywhere**: Full async/await for performance
4. **Real database testing**: testcontainers over mocks

### Development Workflow
1. **Taskfile automation**: Simplified commands for all operations
2. **Pre-commit security**: Gitleaks prevents secret commits
3. **Transaction isolation**: Tests share session with API
4. **Atlas migrations**: Modern approach over Alembic

### Code Organization
```
src/workout_api/
├── auth/           # Complete auth domain
├── exercises/      # Complete exercise domain  
├── workouts/       # Complete workout domain
└── shared/         # Minimal shared utilities
```

## Current Challenges
- None identified yet - design phase complete

## Notes for Implementation
- Follow docs/backend_design.md strictly
- Use SQLAlchemy 2.0 syntax (Mapped, mapped_column)
- Ensure all database operations are async
- Implement proper error handling from the start
- Set up comprehensive logging
