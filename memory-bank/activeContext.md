# Active Context

## Current State (Updated January 2025)

### **✅ COMPLETED: Database Seeding System**

A comprehensive database seeding system has been implemented and refactored for maintainability:

#### **Seeding Infrastructure**
- **Base Seeder Pattern**: Abstract `BaseSeeder` class with common functionality (dry-run, force mode, progress tracking)
- **Registry System**: `SeederRegistry` for managing and discovering available seeders
- **Exercise Seeder**: Complete implementation for loading system exercises from CSV files
- **Result Tracking**: Comprehensive `SeedResult` class tracking created, updated, skipped, and error counts

#### **CLI Interface & Safety**
- **Production Safety**: Mandatory confirmation for production database seeding
- **Flexible Targeting**: Database URL override support for seeding any environment
- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview seeding operations without making changes
- **Force Mode**: Override existing item checks for re-seeding
- **Verbose Logging**: Detailed progress tracking and debug information

#### **Task Integration**
- **General Commands**: `task seed` for all seeders, `task seed:list` to show available seeders
- **Specific Commands**: `task seed:exercises` for exercise-only seeding
- **Production Commands**: `task seed:prod` with explicit database URL requirements
- **Flexible Arguments**: Pass-through CLI arguments for all seeding options

#### **Code Quality & Architecture**
- **Refactored Structure**: Large `main()` function broken into focused, single-purpose functions
- **Clean Separation**: Argument parsing, database initialization, seeder execution, and summary reporting
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with detailed error reporting
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during seeding operations

### **✅ COMPLETED: Secure Authentication Refactor**

The authentication system has been completely refactored with secure Auth.js implementation:

#### **Security Improvements**
- **Fixed Critical Vulnerability**: Removed insecure `/verify-google-user` endpoint that blindly trusted frontend data
- **Added Secure Verification**: New `/verify-token` endpoint uses Google's official tokeninfo API for proper token validation
- **Eliminated Client Storage**: Removed all localStorage usage in favor of secure HTTP-only cookies
- **Extended Token Life**: Increased access token expiry to 6 hours (eliminating refresh token complexity)

#### **Architecture Simplification**
- **Backend Changes**: Removed insecure endpoints (`/verify-google-user`, `/refresh`, `/dev-login`)
- **Frontend Changes**: Simplified Auth.js configuration to use only Google OAuth
- **Service Layer**: Streamlined AuthService with only secure Google token verification method
- **Dead Code Removal**: Cleaned up all unused schemas, test files, and service methods

### **Current System Status**

#### **Database Management**
- **Seeding System**: Production-ready system for initializing database with system exercises
- **Migration System**: Atlas-based schema management with version control
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive validation and error handling for all data operations
- **Multi-Environment**: Safe seeding across development, staging, and production environments

#### **Backend API (Secure)**
- **Authentication Endpoint**: `/api/v1/auth/verify-token` - Securely verifies Google OAuth tokens
- **Session Management**: `/api/v1/auth/me` - Returns user session info
- **Token Validation**: `/api/v1/auth/validate` - Validates JWT tokens
- **Data Management**: Full CRUD operations for users, exercises, workouts, and sets

#### **Development Workflow**
- **Code Quality**: All linting and formatting rules enforced with refactored codebase
- **Testing Coverage**: 305+ tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- **Task Automation**: Streamlined commands for all development operations
- **Production Readiness**: Safe deployment patterns with proper environment checks

### **Next Steps**

The backend infrastructure is now complete with both authentication and data management systems. Ready for:

1. **Data Population**: Use seeding system to populate development and production environments
2. **Frontend Development**: Build UI components with full backend API support
3. **Production Deployment**: Deploy with proper Google OAuth credentials and seeded data
4. **Feature Expansion**: Add workout templates, analytics, and advanced features

### **Key Technical Decisions**

- **Modular Seeding**: Extensible seeder registry pattern for future data types
- **Safety First**: Production environment protections and confirmation requirements
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-structured code following SOLID principles
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage including seeding system validation
- **Developer Experience**: Simple task commands for all common operations

The seeding system represents the final piece of core backend infrastructure, providing a robust foundation for data management across all environments while maintaining the same high standards of security and code quality established in the authentication system.
