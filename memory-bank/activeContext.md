## Recent Work Completed

### **Authlib OAuth Migration (LATEST) ✅**
- **Complete OAuth Replacement**: Successfully migrated from hand-rolled OAuth implementation to Authlib's FastAPI client
  - Replaced custom `GoogleOAuthManager` with `AuthlibGoogleManager` using Authlib's battle-tested OAuth implementation
  - Added SessionMiddleware for secure OAuth state management and CSRF protection
  - Simplified OAuth endpoints by leveraging Authlib's built-in functionality
  - Maintained same public API for AuthService - no breaking changes to business logic

- **Enhanced Security & Maintainability**: Major improvements in OAuth security and code quality
  - **Built-in CSRF protection** via session-based state management (no more manual cookie handling)
  - **Battle-tested OAuth implementation** - Authlib is used by major projects and receives regular security updates
  - **Simplified codebase** - Removed ~100 lines of manual OAuth code and complex state validation
  - **Better error handling** - Authlib provides comprehensive OAuth error scenarios

- **Streamlined Architecture**: Cleaner, more maintainable OAuth flow
  - **Router simplification**: `/auth/google` now directly redirects using `oauth.google.authorize_redirect()`
  - **Callback simplification**: `/auth/google/callback` uses `oauth.google.authorize_access_token()` for complete flow
  - **Automatic token exchange and user info retrieval** - No more manual HTTP client management
  - **Session middleware integration** - Proper session management with configurable security settings

- **Updated Test Suite**: Comprehensive testing of new Authlib integration
  - Updated 20 OAuth tests to focus on Authlib integration rather than manual HTTP calls
  - Simplified test scenarios since Authlib handles underlying OAuth complexity
  - All 201 tests passing - no regressions in existing functionality
  - Maintained GoogleUserInfo tests since interface remains unchanged

## Critical Technical Learnings Documented

### Orval API Client Generation Best Practices (NEW)
**Configuration Lessons**:
- **Single File Mode**: Use `mode: "single"` to avoid duplicate function declarations in generated code
- **Tags-Split Issues**: `mode: "tags-split"` can cause duplicate function generation when endpoints share similar paths
- **Path Conflicts**: Ensure no duplicate route patterns across different routers to prevent generation conflicts

**Development Workflow**:
```bash
# Backend: Generate and validate OpenAPI spec
task generate-openapi
task validate-openapi

# Frontend: Full API refresh workflow
npm run refresh-api    # Regenerates spec + client
npm run dev:full      # Refresh + start dev server
```

**Frontend Integration**:
- Import from single generated file: `@/lib/api/generated`
- Use React Query hooks for queries: `useEndpointNameGet`
- Use React Query mutations for commands: `useEndpointNamePost`
- All authentication, error handling, and baseURL management is automatic

### SQLAlchemy ORM Delete Pattern (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Raw SQL DELETE operations cause foreign key constraint violations
**Solution**: Use ORM delete operations with proper cache management

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Bypasses cascade behavior
delete_stmt = delete(ExerciseExecution).where(...)
result = await session.execute(delete_stmt)  # ForeignKeyViolationError!

# ✅ CORRECT: Respects cascade="all, delete-orphan"
stmt = select(ExerciseExecution).where(...)
execution = await session.execute(stmt).scalar_one_or_none()
await session.delete(execution)  # Triggers cascades
await session.flush()            # Transaction visibility
session.expire_all()             # Clear relationship cache
```

**Key Rules**:
- Never use raw SQL DELETE for related entities
- Always use ORM `session.delete(object)` operations
- Call `session.flush()` (async) before `session.expire_all()` (sync)
- Cache invalidation prevents stale relationship queries

## Environment Setup Instructions

### Required .env File Configuration
Users need to create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://workout_user:workout_pass@localhost:5432/workout_db?sslmode=disable

# Production Database (for future use)
PROD_DB_CONNECTION_URI=postgresql://user:pass@prod-host:5432/workout_db_prod?sslmode=require

# Other required variables (see .env.example for complete list)
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-with-at-least-32-characters-for-security
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-specific-secret-key-with-at-least-32-characters
# ... etc
```

**Important Notes:**
- **Atlas Integration**: Database URLs are now loaded automatically from .env file
- **Migration Status**: Schema is current and deployed in local environment
