- **Test Count**: Maintained 165 passing tests after removal (102 existing + 63 exercise)

## Critical Technical Learnings Documented

### SQLAlchemy ORM Delete Pattern (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Raw SQL DELETE operations cause foreign key constraint violations
**Solution**: Use ORM delete operations with proper cache management

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Bypasses cascade behavior
delete_stmt = delete(ExerciseExecution).where(...)
result = await session.execute(delete_stmt)  # ForeignKeyViolationError!

# ✅ CORRECT: Respects cascade="all, delete-orphan"
stmt = select(ExerciseExecution).where(...)
execution = await session.execute(stmt).scalar_one_or_none()
await session.delete(execution)  # Triggers cascades
await session.flush()            # Transaction visibility
session.expire_all()             # Clear relationship cache
```

**Key Rules**:
- Never use raw SQL DELETE for related entities
- Always use ORM `session.delete(object)` operations
- Call `session.flush()` (async) before `session.expire_all()` (sync)
- Cache invalidation prevents stale relationship queries

## Environment Setup Instructions

### Required .env File Configuration
Users need to create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://workout_user:workout_pass@localhost:5432/workout_db?sslmode=disable

# Production Database (for future use)
PROD_DB_CONNECTION_URI=postgresql://user:pass@prod-host:5432/workout_db_prod?sslmode=require

# Other required variables (see .env.example for complete list)
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-with-at-least-32-characters-for-security
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-specific-secret-key-with-at-least-32-characters
# ... etc
```

**Important Notes:**
- **Atlas Integration**: Database URLs are now loaded automatically from .env file
- **Migration Status**: Schema is current and deployed in local environment
