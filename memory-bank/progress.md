# Progress Tracking

## Completed Work

### ‚úÖ Initial Planning Phase
- Defined project scope and MVP features
- Created comprehensive data model
- Designed RESTful API endpoints
- Technology stack decisions

### ‚úÖ API Design
- Complete REST API specification in `docs/api_proposal.md`
- Nested resource patterns for workout tracking
- Exercise search functionality
- User statistics endpoints
- Consistent error handling patterns

### ‚úÖ Data Model
- Finalized core entities in `docs/datamodel.md`
- User, Exercise, Workout, ExerciseExecution, Set
- Business rules (one exercise per workout)
- Deferred WorkoutTemplate to future iteration

### ‚úÖ Backend Architecture
- Comprehensive design principles in `docs/backend_design.md`
- Functional cohesion structure
- Repository + Service layer patterns
- Transaction isolation for testing
- Async-first approach with FastAPI
- Development workflow with Taskfiles
- Security-first with pre-commit hooks

### ‚úÖ Technology Stack Finalized
- **Backend**: Python 3.12+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0, PostgreSQL
- **Testing**: pytest, testcontainers, transaction isolation
- **Development**: uv, Atlas, ruff, pre-commit, gitleaks
- **Frontend** (Future): Next.js 14, TypeScript, ShadCN

## Current Status

### üèóÔ∏è Ready to Build
- Backend design complete
- All architectural decisions made
- Development patterns established
- Testing strategy defined

### üìã Next Implementation Steps

#### 1. Project Setup (Next)
- [ ] Initialize project with uv

- [ ] Database connection setup
- [ ] Configuration management
- [ ] Atlas migration setup
- [ ] Logging configuration

#### 3. Auth Implementation
- [ ] Google OAuth integration
- [ ] JWT token management
- [ ] User model and endpoints
- [ ] Authentication middleware
- [ ] Authorization decorators

#### 4. Exercise Module
- [ ] Exercise models and schemas
- [ ] Repository implementation
- [ ] Service layer with business logic
- [ ] API endpoints
- [ ] Search functionality

#### 5. Workout Module
- [ ] Workout/ExerciseExecution/Set models
- [ ] Complex nested operations
- [ ] Transaction handling
- [ ] API endpoints with nesting
- [ ] Statistics calculations

#### 6. Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] pytest configuration
- [ ] testcontainers setup
- [ ] Transaction fixtures
- [ ] Test data factories
- [ ] Integration test patterns

## Known Issues/Blockers
- None currently

## Deferred Features
- WorkoutTemplate functionality
- Real-time sync
- Offline support
- Mobile app
- Advanced analytics
- Social features

## Performance Targets
- API response time < 200ms (p95)
- Support 1000+ workouts per user
- Handle 100 concurrent users
- Database query optimization

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All API endpoints implemented
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Clean code (ruff passing)
- [ ] Documented API (OpenAPI)
- [ ] Development environment working

## Notes
- Following backend-first approach per user decision
- Frontend will be built after API is stable
- Using docs/backend_design.md as implementation guide
- Memory bank will be updated after each major milestone
