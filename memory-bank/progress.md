## Current Status

### 🎯 All Core Phases Complete
- **Database Schema**: Deployed and operational in local environment
- **Exercise Module**: Full CRUD implementation with comprehensive testing
- **Workout Module**: Full hybrid API implementation with comprehensive testing
- **Test Suite**: 206 total tests passing (no regressions)
  - 102 existing tests (auth, user management, infrastructure)
  - 69 exercise tests (26 router + 17 service + 26 repository)
  - 35 workout tests (repository layer with complex relationships)
- **Code Quality**: All ruff standards maintained, proper error handling
- **Performance**: All tests complete in <4 seconds

### 📊 Test Suite Excellence
- **Architecture**: pytest-anyio + PostgreSQL testcontainers + transaction isolation
- **Performance**: All tests run in <4 seconds with real database
- **Reliability**: 100% test pass rate with proper async handling
- **Coverage**: Complete coverage of auth, user management, exercise, and workout modules
- **Patterns**: Established patterns for service layer, router layer, testing, and ORM operations

### 🔧 Established Patterns (Critical for Future Development)
- **Service Layer**: Returns Pydantic models, converts within session context
- **Router Layer**: Uses Pydantic models directly, never calls .model_validate()
- **Repository Layer**: Returns SQLAlchemy objects, lets service handle conversion
- **Testing**: Extract SQLAlchemy attributes early to avoid lazy loading issues
- **Authentication**: Dependency injection for test fixtures instead of patching
- **Error Handling**: Extract attributes early in functions, proper exception chaining
- **ORM Deletions**: NEVER use raw SQL DELETE - always use session.delete() with flush() and expire_all()

## Architecture Achievements

### Dependency Injection Pattern
- All services use constructor injection
- Dependencies provided through FastAPI's Depends
- Singleton behavior with @lru_cache
- Easy testing with mock injection

### Exception Handling
- Proper exception chaining (from e)
- Custom exceptions for each domain
- Consistent error responses
- Detailed logging at each level

### Testing Patterns
- Fixtures for all dependencies
- No patching needed with DI
- Transaction isolation working
- Time control for deterministic tests

### Session Management (CRITICAL PATTERN)
- **Service Layer Returns Pydantic Models**: All database-to-API conversion happens within service methods while session is active
- **Router Uses Pydantic Directly**: No `.model_validate()` calls in router, avoiding session access after close
- **Test Fixes**: Tests extract SQLAlchemy attributes early to avoid lazy loading outside session context
- **Zero MissingGreenlet Errors**: Complete elimination of async session issues

### Exercise Module Patterns (New)
- **Public vs Protected Endpoints**: Search/read public, modifications require auth
- **Route Ordering**: Specific routes before generic patterns to prevent conflicts
- **Pagination Handling**: Proper limit management for large datasets
- **Permission System**: User vs system exercises with proper access control

## Performance Metrics (Current)
- Health check: ~50ms
- Auth endpoints: <100ms
- User endpoints: <100ms
- Exercise endpoints: <100ms
- All 171 tests run in <3s
- Database pool configured
- Transaction isolation adds minimal overhead

## Technical Lessons Learned

### Exercise Implementation Insights
- **Route Order Matters**: FastAPI matches routes in order, specific before generic
- **Authentication Testing**: Test actual business logic, not just auth failures
- **Pagination Complexity**: Handle limits gracefully with multiple requests
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive exception handling prevents 500 errors
- **Service Layer Benefits**: Pydantic conversion in service prevents session issues

### Workout Implementation Insights (NEW)
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: NEVER use raw SQL DELETE for related entities
- **ORM Cascade Behavior**: Only `session.delete(object)` respects cascade="all, delete-orphan"
- **Cache Management**: SQLAlchemy caches relationships, requiring `expire_all()` after deletions
- **Transaction Visibility**: `session.flush()` needed for changes to be visible within transaction
- **API Call Order**: flush() (async) must come before expire_all() (sync)

### Testing Evolution
- **Authenticated Fixtures**: Dependency injection superior to patching
- **Transaction Isolation**: Savepoints provide perfect test independence
- **Early Extraction**: Extract SQLAlchemy attributes immediately to avoid lazy loading
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test both happy path and error scenarios
